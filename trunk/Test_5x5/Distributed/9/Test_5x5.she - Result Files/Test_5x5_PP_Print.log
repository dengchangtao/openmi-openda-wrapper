 Making UZ setup...
 Loading Two-layer UZ data...
 UZ Setup finished.

INFO   : The specific yield of the top SZ layer has been adjusted. The new specific yield is the difference between the
         water contents at saturation and field capacity, based on the two-layer UZ soil type.
         This adjustment will provide an optimal stability for the UZ-SZ coupling.
